Zeebe supports two security features that you should be aware of:

- **[Transport Layer Security](../transport-layer-security)** - allows you to secure communication between clients and gateways.
- **[Authorization](../authorization)** - allows you to supply access credentials to the client so these can be validated by a reverse proxy placed before the gateway.
